# Homepage of Everett

This is homepage of Everett.

I am currently studying at University of Miami. 

I triple major in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Philosophy.

I am on [GitHub](https://github.com/kiruko1025) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/everett-xu-5934a1292/).

Checkout my [blog](everett.cool) for things I have written.

You can also see my [personal page](/docs/Hobbies/index.md) to know more about me besides academics.
